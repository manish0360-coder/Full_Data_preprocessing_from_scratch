# Full Data Preprocessing From Scratch

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete and hard-level implementation of **data preprocessing from scratch** for machine learning.  
All preprocessing steps are implemented manually to understand the logic behind automated libraries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand real-world data cleaning techniques
- Implement preprocessing without relying on high-level pipelines
- Build strong foundations for machine learning workflows

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Implemented
- Handling missing values (mean, median, mode logic)
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Categorical data encoding
- Feature scaling (normalization & standardization)
- Data transformation and preparation for ML models
- Step-by-step explanation with clear logic

---

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`  
  Contains the complete preprocessing workflow implemented from scratch with explanations.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?
Most ML failures happen due to poor data preprocessing.  
This project focuses on mastering preprocessing fundamentals to build **robust and reliable ML models**.

---

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Python for data manipulation
- Strong understanding of preprocessing internals
- Machine learning readiness

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add preprocessing pipeline class
- Apply preprocessing to real-world datasets
- Visualize outliers and feature distributions
